## The Exponential Advantage

Traditional approach (sequential, human-limited):
- Train 1 hospital → 2 years
- Reach 100 hospitals → 200 years
- Reach 1M workers → 1,000+ years

**Our approach (exponential, AI-driven):**
- Deploy platform → Day 1
- Reach 1M workers → 4 years (through viral growth + ML optimization)
- Continuous improvement → Autonomous (no human bottleneck)
- Impact scales infinitely → Not limited by number of trainers

This is why we're not building sequentially. We're building exponentially.
