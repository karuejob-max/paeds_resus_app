# Aluta Continua - The Struggle Continues

## Mission Statement

**No child should die from preventable causes.**

This is not a goal. This is not an objective. This is the fundamental reason Paeds Resus exists.

## The Struggle

The struggle is not against technology. The struggle is not against systems. The struggle is against preventable death.

Every day, children die from causes we know how to prevent. Sepsis. Respiratory distress. Cardiac arrest. Malaria. Dehydration. Malnutrition. Vaccine-preventable diseases.

These deaths are not inevitable. They are not acts of God. They are failures of systems. They are failures of access. They are failures of knowledge. They are failures of will.

**Paeds Resus exists to eliminate these failures.**

1. **Training every healthcare worker** who can save a child's life

## The Commitment to Aluta Continua

The struggle continues. Not because we have not succeeded. But because success means more children are alive. More children are alive means more children need protection. More children need protection means the struggle continues.

**Aluta continua.**

We will not stop until every child in Africa has access to world-class pediatric training. We will not stop until preventable deaths are eliminated. We will not stop until the mission is achieved.

And when the mission is achieved in Africa, we will expand to other continents. We will expand until no child anywhere dies from preventable causes.

**The struggle is eternal. The commitment is unwavering. The mission is sacred.**
