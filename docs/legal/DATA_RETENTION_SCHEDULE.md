# Data Retention Schedule

**Document:** DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE.md  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective date:** 27 May 2026  
**Last updated:** 27 May 2026  
**Status:** Counsel review draft — operational baseline  
**Controller:** Paeds Resus Limited, Nairobi, Kenya  
**Contact:** privacy@paeds-resus.com  
**Linked from:** PRIVACY_POLICY_FULL.md §11  

---

## 1. Purpose

This schedule defines **how long** Paeds Resus Limited retains categories of personal data, **where** it is stored, and **how** deletion or anonymisation is executed. It aligns with SECURITY_BASELINE.md §4 and engineering table names in `drizzle/schema.ts`.

**Review cycle:** Annual, or upon material product change. Counsel must confirm periods for Kenya DPA and tax law.

---

## 2. Retention principles

1. **Data minimisation** — retain only as long as necessary for the purpose  
2. **QI and safety** — Care Signal retained long enough for learning cycles and limitation periods  
3. **Financial audit** — payment logs meet tax and reconciliation needs  
4. **Account deletion** — manual workflow until automated (DSAR_PROCEDURE.md)  
5. **Legal hold** — suspend deletion when litigation or investigation requires

## 4. Product-specific notes

### 4.1 Care Signal

- Not a medical record — retention driven by QI governance and fellowship audit  
- Aggregates may survive event-level deletion in statistical form  
- Rate-limit counters: ephemeral or **90 days**

### 4.2 Parent Safe-Truth

- Never merged into Care Signal KPIs  
- Bereavement submissions: access limited to trained reviewers; no marketing reuse  
- Guardian consent version retained per account

### 4.3 ResusGPS

- No server-side retention of session age/weight unless user saves Fellowship case  
- Legacy `localStorage` migration removes persistent clinical context

### 4.4 Institutional

- On MOU termination: export window **30 days**; deletion **90 days** unless dispute  
- Staff unlinking does not delete historical Care Signal attributed to provider ID

## 5. Deletion workflows

| Trigger | Process |
|---------|---------|
| User DSAR erasure | DSAR_PROCEDURE.md — verify identity, check exceptions |
| Account closure request | support@paeds-resus.com → manual checklist |
| Institutional exit | INSTITUTIONAL_B2B_ADDENDUM Part B.8 |
| Automated purge jobs | **Engineering — `pnpm run retention:cleanup` (dry-run default); monthly scheduler dry-run log; `--execute` after ops review** |

**Exceptions to erasure:** Legal obligation, tax, fraud investigation, fellowship dispute resolution, anonymous aggregates.

---

## 6. Archiving and exports

Before deleting `adminAuditLog` or Care Signal batches:

- Export CSV to secure storage if MOU or litigation requires  
- Encrypt at rest; access limited to privacy@ and legal@  

---

## 7. Children's data

Safe-Truth child-related narratives follow Safe-Truth row retention; erasure requests prioritised for review within **30 days**.

---

## 8. Cross-border

Data in **Aiven EU** remains subject to this schedule regardless of user country. Backups inherit provider retention.
