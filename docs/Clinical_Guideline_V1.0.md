# Paeds Resus Clinical Guideline Version 1.0

## Pediatric Emergency Assessment and Management Protocol

**Document Type:** Clinical Guideline — Protocol Foundation  
**Version:** PG-V1.0  
**Effective Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Evidence Base:** AHA PALS 2025, WHO ETAT+, APLS 7th Edition  
**Target Setting:** Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)  
**Target Users:** Nurses, Clinical Officers, Medical Officers, Pediatricians

---

## Purpose Statement

This clinical guideline provides the foundational protocols for the Paeds Resus Real-Time Clinical Decision Support System. It establishes the sequential assessment framework, intervention triggers, and escalation pathways that guide providers through pediatric emergencies. The guideline is designed to eliminate the knowledge-action gap that causes preventable pediatric deaths in resource-limited settings.

**Core Principle:** One patient, one moment, one best next step.

## Part I: Initial Approach — The First 60 Seconds

### 1.1 Triage Triangle (Visual Assessment)

Before touching the patient, assess from the doorway using the Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT):

| Component | What to Look For | Abnormal Finding |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Appearance** | Tone, interactivity, consolability, look/gaze, speech/cry | Limp, unresponsive, inconsolable, vacant stare, weak cry |
| **Work of Breathing** | Respiratory rate, retractions, nasal flaring, head bobbing, positioning | Tachypnea, severe retractions, tripod position, grunting |
| **Circulation** | Skin color | Pallor, mottling, cyanosis |

**Interpretation:**

| PAT Finding | Likely Category | Urgency |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| All normal | Stable | Routine assessment |
| Abnormal appearance only | CNS dysfunction or metabolic | Urgent |
| Abnormal breathing only | Respiratory distress | Urgent |
| Abnormal circulation only | Compensated shock | Urgent |
| Abnormal appearance + breathing | Respiratory failure | Critical |
| Abnormal appearance + circulation | Decompensated shock | Critical |
| All abnormal | Cardiopulmonary failure | Immediate resuscitation |

### 1.2 Responsiveness Check

**Action:** Approach patient and assess responsiveness using AVPU scale.

| Level | Stimulus | Response | Interpretation |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **A** - Alert | None needed | Eyes open, tracks, responds | Conscious |
| **V** - Voice | Verbal stimulus | Responds to voice | Decreased consciousness |
| **P** - Pain | Painful stimulus | Responds to pain only | Severely decreased |
| **U** - Unresponsive | Painful stimulus | No response | Unresponsive |

**Critical Decision Point:**

> **If AVPU = U (Unresponsive) AND no breathing or only gasping:**  
> → **ACTIVATE BLS/ALS PATHWAY IMMEDIATELY**  
> → Call for help  
> → Begin CPR (30:2 if alone, 15:2 if two rescuers)  
> → Attach defibrillator/monitor as soon as available

### 1.3 Signs of Life Check

**Action:** Simultaneously assess breathing and pulse (maximum 10 seconds).

| Assessment | Method | Normal | Abnormal |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Breathing** | Look, listen, feel | Regular chest rise | Absent, gasping, agonal |
| **Pulse** | Brachial (<1 year) or carotid (≥1 year) | Present, regular | Absent or <60 with poor perfusion |

**Critical Decision Points:**

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| No breathing, no pulse | Begin CPR immediately |
| No breathing, pulse present | Rescue breathing (1 breath every 2-3 seconds) |
| Breathing, pulse present | Continue to ABCDE assessment |
| Pulse <60 with poor perfusion | Begin CPR (treat as pulseless) |

---

## Part II: Primary Survey — ABCDE Assessment

The ABCDE approach is a systematic method to identify and treat life-threatening conditions in order of priority. Each step includes assessment, identification of problems, and immediate interventions. **Do not proceed to the next step until the current step is stabilized or help is called.**

### 2.1 A — Airway

**Goal:** Ensure airway is patent and maintainable.

#### Assessment

| Check | Method | Normal | Abnormal |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Patency** | Look in mouth, listen | Clear, no sounds | Secretions, blood, foreign body, swelling |
| **Position** | Observe head/neck | Neutral or sniffing | Hyperextended, flexed |
| **Sounds** | Listen without stethoscope | Quiet breathing | Stridor, gurgling, snoring |
| **Auscultation** | Stethoscope at neck/chest | Air entry bilateral | Stridor, wheeze, absent sounds |

#### Problem Identification

| Finding | Likely Problem | Urgency |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Gurgling | Secretions/blood | Immediate |
| Snoring | Tongue obstruction | Immediate |
| Stridor (inspiratory) | Upper airway obstruction | Urgent |
| Stridor (biphasic) | Severe obstruction | Critical |
| No air movement | Complete obstruction | Critical |

#### Interventions (Sequential)

**Step 1: Basic Airway Maneuvers**

| Intervention | Technique | Indication |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **Suction** | Yankauer or soft catheter, visible secretions only | Gurgling, visible secretions |
| **Head positioning** | Neutral (infant) or sniffing (child) | Snoring, tongue obstruction |
| **Jaw thrust** | Lift mandible anteriorly | Trauma or if positioning fails |
| **Chin lift** | Lift chin, open mouth | Non-trauma, simple obstruction |

**Step 2: Airway Adjuncts (if basic maneuvers fail)**

| Device | Sizing | Indication | Contraindication |
|--------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **OPA** | Corner of mouth to angle of jaw | Unconscious, no gag reflex | Conscious, gag present |
| **NPA** | Tip of nose to tragus of ear | Decreased consciousness, gag present | Basal skull fracture, coagulopathy |

**Step 3: Advanced Airway (if adjuncts fail)**

| Device | Indication | Provider Level |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **LMA/i-gel** | Cannot ventilate with BVM, not trained for ETT | Any trained provider |
| **ETT** | Prolonged ventilation, airway protection needed | Trained provider only |

#### Reassessment After Intervention

| Check | Expected Outcome | If Not Achieved |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| Air movement | Audible, bilateral | Reposition, re-attempt |
| Chest rise | Visible, symmetric | Check for obstruction |
| Oxygen saturation | Improving or stable | Escalate to next intervention |

**Escalation Trigger:** If airway cannot be secured after 2 attempts at each level → Call for expert help immediately.
