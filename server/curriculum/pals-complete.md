## Module 1: Pediatric Assessment and Physiology (8 hours)

### Lesson 1.1: Pediatric Airway Anatomy
**Duration:** 60 minutes | **Type:** Video + Interactive

Understanding pediatric airway anatomy is fundamental to managing pediatric airways.

**Key Anatomical Differences from Adults:**
- Larger, more anterior larynx positioned higher (C3-C4 vs. C4-C6)
- Larger, more floppy epiglottis
- Narrower airway at cricoid ring (funnel-shaped vs. cylindrical)
- Shorter neck with larger head
- Larger tongue relative to mouth size
- Obligate nasal breathing in infants
- Smaller diameter endotracheal tubes required

**Age-Specific Airway Characteristics:**

| Age | Airway Diameter | Epiglottis | Larynx Position |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Infant | 4-5 mm | Large, floppy | High (C3-C4) |
| Toddler | 5-6 mm | Large, floppy | High (C3-C4) |
| Preschool | 6-7 mm | Moderate | Moderate (C3-C4) |
| School age | 7-8 mm | Smaller | Lower (C4-C5) |
| Adolescent | 8-9 mm | Adult-like | Adult-like (C4-C6) |

**Clinical Implications:**
- Smaller airways more easily obstructed by swelling, secretions, foreign bodies
- Obligate nasal breathing in infants means nasal obstruction causes respiratory distress
- Larger head and shorter neck affect positioning for intubation
- Narrower airway at cricoid ring means uncuffed tubes often used in young children

### Lesson 1.2: Pediatric Cardiovascular Physiology
**Duration:** 60 minutes | **Type:** Video + Assessment

Pediatric cardiovascular physiology differs significantly from adults, affecting shock recognition and management.

**Key Physiological Differences:**
- Higher cardiac output due to higher heart rate, not stroke volume
- Stroke volume relatively fixed in infants
- Cardiac output = Heart Rate × Stroke Volume
- Increased dependence on heart rate for cardiac output
- Greater sympathetic reserve
- Compensated shock may appear relatively well while being profoundly hypoperfused

**Age-Specific Vital Signs:**

| Age | Heart Rate | Systolic BP | Respiratory Rate |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Infant (0-3 mo) | 100-160 | 50-70 | 30-60 |
| Infant (3-6 mo) | 100-160 | 60-90 | 25-40 |
| Infant (6-12 mo) | 100-160 | 70-100 | 25-35 |
| Toddler (1-3 yr) | 90-150 | 80-110 | 20-30 |
| Preschool (3-6 yr) | 80-120 | 80-110 | 20-25 |
| School age (6-12 yr) | 70-110 | 90-130 | 18-22 |
| Adolescent (>12 yr) | 60-100 | 100-140 | 12-20 |

**Shock in Children:**
- Compensated shock: Tachycardia, tachypnea, cool extremities, delayed capillary refill, normal blood pressure
- Decompensated shock: Bradycardia (ominous), hypotension, altered mental status, weak pulses, severe cyanosis
- Blood pressure is a LATE sign of shock in children

**Assessment:** Learner must identify normal vs. abnormal vital signs for age.

---

### Lesson 1.3: Pediatric Respiratory Physiology
**Duration:** 60 minutes | **Type:** Video + Assessment

Pediatric respiratory physiology affects oxygen delivery and ventilation strategies.

**Key Physiological Differences:**
- Higher metabolic rate and oxygen consumption
- Smaller functional residual capacity
- Faster respiratory rate
- Obligate nasal breathing in infants
- Diaphragmatic breathing (abdominal)
- Less developed intercostal muscles
- Chest wall more compliant
- Airway resistance inversely proportional to radius (critical in small airways)

**Oxygen Delivery:**
- Oxygen delivery = Cardiac output × Arterial oxygen content
- Arterial oxygen content = (Hemoglobin × 1.34 × SaO2) + (PaO2 × 0.003)
- Children have higher hemoglobin and higher oxygen consumption
- Rapid desaturation with apnea due to lower functional residual capacity

**Ventilation Strategies:**
- Higher respiratory rates for younger children
- Smaller tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg)
- Avoid excessive ventilation (increases intrathoracic pressure, decreases venous return)
- Maintain permissive hypercapnia if needed (PaCO2 35-45 mmHg)

**Assessment:** Learner must calculate appropriate ventilation parameters for different ages.

**Prognostic Factors:**
- **Favorable:** Witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, short time to ROSC, shockable rhythm, young age
- **Unfavorable:** Unwitnessed arrest, no bystander CPR, long time to ROSC, non-shockable rhythm, comorbidities

**Neurological Assessment:**
- Glasgow Coma Scale
- Pupil response
- Corneal reflex
- Gag reflex
- Motor response

**Imaging:**
- CT head: Identify structural lesions
- MRI: Assess ischemic injury (delayed)

**Assessment:** Learner must assess neurological prognosis.

### Lesson 7.3: Pediatric Complications of Resuscitation
**Duration:** 60 minutes | **Type:** Video + Case Study

Resuscitation can cause complications requiring recognition and management.

**Complications:**
- Rib fractures
- Pneumothorax
- Hemothorax
- Cardiac contusion
- Splenic rupture
- Hepatic laceration
- Anoxic brain injury
- Aspiration pneumonia
- Sepsis

**Management:**

### Lesson 7.4: Pediatric Organ Donation and End-of-Life Care
**Duration:** 60 minutes | **Type:** Video + Assessment

After unsuccessful resuscitation, organ donation and end-of-life care are important considerations.

**Organ Donation:**
- Identify potential donors
- Notify organ procurement organization
- Maintain organ perfusion
- Support family decision-making
- Facilitate donation process

**End-of-Life Care:**
- Discontinue resuscitation when appropriate
- Provide comfort care
- Support family
- Facilitate grief counseling
- Arrange autopsy if indicated

**Assessment:** Learner must identify appropriate end-of-life care.
