# Kaizen Framework - Continuous Improvement System

## Philosophy
**Kaizen** (改善) = "Change for the better" - Continuous, incremental improvement embedded into organizational DNA.

The Paeds Resus platform operates on kaizen principles: never satisfied, always improving, forever committed to mission of zero preventable child deaths.

## Core Principles

1. **Continuous Improvement** - Every day is better than yesterday
2. **Measurement-Driven** - What gets measured gets improved
3. **Exponential Compounding** - Small daily improvements compound into exponential impact
4. **Autonomy** - Systems improve themselves without human intervention
5. **Mission-Aligned** - Every optimization serves the mission: No child should die from preventable causes

- User engagement rate (target: 80%+)
- Data accuracy (target: 99.9%+)
- Cost per life saved (target: <$250)
- Registration completion rate (target: 95%+)
- Course start rate (target: 70%+)
- Referral click-through rate (target: 25%+)

**Automated Actions**:
- Auto-scale infrastructure based on load
- Optimize database queries with slow query detection
- Cache layer management
- CDN optimization
- Real-time error monitoring and alerts
- Automatic rollback on performance degradation

**Success Criteria**: 
- Response time stays <100ms

---

### 4. QUARTERLY STRATEGIC REVIEW (Every Quarter)
**Focus**: Strategic adjustments and major feature releases

**Quarterly Goals Tracking**:
- Facilities onboarded (target: 50/Q)
- Healthcare workers trained (target: 10,000/Q)
- Lives saved (target: 500/Q)
- Revenue growth (target: +25% QoQ)
- Geographic expansion (target: 3-5 new countries/Q)
- Market share growth

**Strategic Initiatives**:
- Government partnership acceleration
- Regional hub establishment
- Major feature launches
- Market expansion
- Competitive positioning

**Adjustment Process**:
1. Review quarterly performance vs targets
2. Analyze market conditions and competitive landscape
3. Assess resource allocation efficiency
4. Identify strategic gaps
5. Adjust roadmap and priorities
6. Communicate changes to team

---

### 5. ANNUAL TRANSFORMATION (Every January)
**Focus**: Comprehensive system review and strategic planning

**Annual Goals**:
- Facilities: 200
- Healthcare workers: 50,000
- Lives saved: 5,000+
- Revenue: $1.75M
- Profit: $1.22M
- Countries: 15+

**Transformation Themes**:
- **Q1**: Foundation & Discovery (map infrastructure, establish partnerships)
- **Q2**: Validation & Expansion (prove model, expand, secure contracts)
- **Q3**: Acceleration & Scale (rapid expansion, revenue growth)
- **Q4**: Optimization & Consolidation (efficiency, sustainability, preparation for next year)

**Annual Review Process**:
1. Comprehensive performance analysis
2. Market analysis and competitive assessment
3. Technology stack review and upgrades
4. Organizational capability assessment
5. Financial sustainability review
6. Mission impact measurement
7. Strategic planning for next year
